/** A software simulation of a Disk.
 * You may not change this class.
 * This disk is very slow
 * It contains a number of blocks, all BLOCK_SIZE bytes long.
 * All operations occur on individual blocks.
 * You can't modify any more or any less data at a time.
 * To read or write from the disk, call beginRead() or beginWrite().
 * In a real OS, each of these functions will start the action and
 * return immediately. Only when the action has been completed, the Disk
 * notifies let you know the Disk is ready for more.
 * But in this project, because we haven't learned concurrency, so we
 * will just do sync read/write.
 * It may take a while for the disk to seek from one block to another.
 * Seek time is proportional to the difference in block numbers of the
 * blocks.
 * This disk saves its contents in the Unix file DISK between runs.
 * Since the file can be large, you should get in the habit of removing it
 * before logging off.
