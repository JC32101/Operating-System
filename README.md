You can put [your grading sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10UUbPt577tOs3nh01khaxdMV52efGgv_uZ-HpcQRId0/edit?usp=sharing) in readme too. Click "edit this file" (right pen like icon) to see how to edit a hyperlink. You can't write to this grading sheet because you are expected to make a copy and share it with me(junyuan@cs.stonybrook.edu). After you share it with me you can leave your grading sheet here in readme for easy access. -Jun
